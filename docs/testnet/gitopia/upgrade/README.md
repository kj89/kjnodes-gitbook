**Chain ID**: gitopia-janus-testnet-2 | **Latest Version Tag**: v1.2.0 | **Custom Port**: 41

{% hint style='info' %}
Since we are using Cosmovisor, it makes it very easy to prepare for upcomming upgrade.
You just have to build new binaries and move it into cosmovisor upgrades directory.

{% hint style='warning' %}
Currently gitopia does not have any upgrades!
