**Chain ID**: uptick_7000-2 | **Latest Version Tag**: v0.2.4 | **Custom Port**: 15

{% hint style='info' %}
Since we are using Cosmovisor, it makes it very easy to prepare for upcomming upgrade.
You just have to build new binaries and move it into cosmovisor upgrades directory.

{% hint style='warning' %}
Currently uptick does not have any upgrades!
